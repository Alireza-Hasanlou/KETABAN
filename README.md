# KETABAN

"Ketaban" is a comprehensive library management system built to streamline book cataloging, borrowing, and user management for academic institutions. Developed in C# and ASP.NET Core MVC, this project uses a robust three-layer architecture for optimized performance, security, and scalability. The primary functionalities include book management, student and librarian profiles, book borrowing and returning systems, and category and language administration. With seamless user authentication and role-based access, librarians can efficiently handle book loans and returns, manage user records, and track library resources in real-time.

Key technologies integrated in "Ketaban" include Entity Framework Core for data handling, ASP.NET Identity for secure authentication, and SweetAlert2 for intuitive alerts, all combining to create a user-friendly and efficient library management experience.
